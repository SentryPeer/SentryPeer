.TH SentryPeer 1 "April 2022" "SentryPeer"
.SH NAME
sentrypeer \- A distributed list of bad IP addresses and phone numbers collected via a SIP Honeypot

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sentrypeer
[\-hVvjplfdrRaws]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B SentryPeer
is basically a fraud detection tool. It lets bad actors try to make phone calls and saves the IP address they came
from and number they tried to call. Those details are then used to block them at the service providers network and the
next time a user/customer tries to call a collected number, it's blocked.

Traditionally this data is shipped to a central place, so you don't own the data you've collected. This project is all
about Peer to Peer sharing of that data. The user owning the data and various Service Provider / Network Provider
related feeds of the data is the key bit for me. I'm sick of all the services out there that keep it and sell it.
If you've collected it, you should have the choice to keep it and/or opt in to share it with other SentryPeer community
members via p2p methods.
