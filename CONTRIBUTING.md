# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are very welcome, both large and small.

Correct patches (see Patch Requirements) will generally be accepted.

This is a small project, so I don't want to get bogged down in too much formality, but in general I'm striving to follow Pieter Hintjens' Collective Code Construction Contract (C4) as used by the ZeroMQ project: https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/

## Patch Requirements

Maintainers and Contributors MUST have a Platform account and SHOULD use their real names or a well-known alias.

A patch SHOULD be a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one identified and agreed problem.

A patch MUST adhere to the code style guidelines of the project (see below)

A patch SHALL NOT include non-trivial code from other projects unless the Contributor is the original author of that code.

A patch MUST compile cleanly and pass project self-tests on at least the principal target platform.

A patch commit message SHOULD consist of a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, optionally followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description.

A "Correct Patch" is one that satisfies the above requirements.
