sentrypeer (0.0.5-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Switched from 404 to Error 400 on invalid request data at 
    /ip-addresses/{blah}
  * Handle packets sent that are 0 bytes (discovered by nmap probing port 5060)
  * Only parse SIP packets if UDP packet payload is > 0 bytes
  * Fedora and Debian packaging now available for each release
  * HTTP regex route memory leak fix
  * vue.js SPA is now in for start web gui
  * Remove duplicate uuid_generate call in bad_actor structure
  * Add CORS header to all API responses
  * Add more header checks to configure.ac
  * Switch to recvmsg for receiving UDP packets, so we can save the destination 
    IP address of probes
  * SIP responsive mode can be enabled to reply to SIP probes. This will prompt 
    INVITE's from bad actors for phone call attempts, so you can collect the 
    phone numbers
  * API mode can be set to enable replies to RESTful API requests. Depending 
    on your node deployment type, you may not want to enable this
  * Web GUI mode can be set to enable the Vue.js SPA. Depending on your node 
    deployment type, you might not want this
  * Add seen_last and seen_count bad_actor data structure for use in 
    ip_addresses RESTful API resource
  * ip_addresses RESTful API resource results sorted by seen_last descending
  * Add AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS to configure.ac
  * Web GUI mode needs the API to be enabled, so if you don't set API mode, we 
    automatically set it
  * Clean up test RESTful API code to fix test suite crashes on macOS
  * Highly recommend v5+ of libosip2 via ./configure
  * Correct homebrew installation instructions for SentryPeer
  * Major test suite refactor for memory leak fixes
  * Replies with json no longer leak memory
