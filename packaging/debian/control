Description: SIP peer to peer honeypot for VoIP
 SentryPeer is a distributed list of bad IP addresses and phone numbers
 collected via a SIP Honeypot.
 This is basically a fraud detection tool. It lets bad actors try to make
 phone calls and saves the IP address they came from and number they
 tried to call. Those details are then used to block them at the service
 providers network and the next time a user/customer tries to call a
 collected number, it's blocked.
 .
 Traditionally this data is shipped to a central place, so you don't own
 the data you've collected. This project is all about Peer to Peer sharing
 of that data. The user owning the data and various Service Provider /
 Network Provider related feeds of the data is the key bit for me. I'm
 sick of all the services out there that keep it and sell it. If you've
 collected it, you should have the choice to keep it and/or opt in to
 share it with other SentryPeer community members via p2p methods.
